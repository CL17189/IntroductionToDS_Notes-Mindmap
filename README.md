# IntroductionToDS_Notes&Mindmap
Created for uppsala university's student who registered the course Introduction To DataScience. Any contents involved copyrigh are not contained in this ware because we only use it to review what we have leant.

*FinalReview.ipynb*: An coding cheat sheet including all possible packages when you are taking part in final exam.


*mindmap.pdf*: An mindmap including the knowledge structures from each chapter which are organically combined.

## Updated LOG
2025.02.03
+ Referencable answers for previous exam are added;
+ Good luck!

2025.01.16
+ Revised errors in Markov chain's stationary distribution,double-checked correctness for each methods;
+ Restrcutured the Accept-reject sampler function, making it more robust and clear. Sample checking part is added to verify while still failed making it more efficiency. hint: M is a key to generate correct distribution. That is to say that you can improve the efficiency literally by reducing M but you will lose the accuracy. So hold the baseline for M.
+ Added an example of utils.
+ Created some illustrations of interesting functions in utils.py


2025.01.14
+ Revised Errors in Markov Chain-period; 2 common questions and their instances,carefully reconsidered index input or state input;
+ Revised the parameter problem in uniform-distributed numbers generator, unify `M` and `period` and declare tha they are same explicitly;
+ Restructued Machine Learning part; add an example for calibration section;
+ Catelog is added and we can see it clearly by clicking view->Left Sidebar->show Table of Contents
+ more contents about SVD, SVM and core methods are coming soon.
